Eye Disease Detection Using Fundus Images
This repository contains a project focused on detecting eye diseases using fundus images. The dataset used in this project is hosted on Roboflow and consists of labeled images suitable for training deep learning models.
Dataset
Source: Roboflow Fundus Dataset
Description: Images of human retina (fundus) with annotations for various eye diseases.

Purpose: To train models that can assist in early detection of diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, and other retinal conditions.

Project Overview

Preprocess fundus images for model training.

Build a deep learning model (CNN/ResNet-based) for binary or multi-class classification.

Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

How to Use

1. Clone this repository.

2. Download the dataset from Roboflow.

3. Run the preprocessing scripts and train the model.
